# 👋 Hey, I'm Dwayne

I'm a developer who enjoys building cool stuff web, mobile, whatever feels right.  
Currently studying **Computer Science** at **UOB**.  
I just code sometimes >.<

## 🧠 What I'm up to

- Working on some projects (check the repos 👀)
- Trying to break less stuff in production
- Exploring new tech, one bug at a time
