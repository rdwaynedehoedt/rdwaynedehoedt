# 👋 Yo, I'm Dwayne

sometimes I code.  
sometimes it works.  
most of the time I just stare at the screen and vibe.

I study CS (or at least pretend to).  
I build stuff and push to GitHub like I know what I'm doing.

> “if it compiles, ship it.” – me probably

## 📦 what's in my repos?
stuff.  
some of it works.  
some of it shouldn't.
